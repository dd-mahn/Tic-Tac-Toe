# Tic-Tac-Toe
TheOdinProject Tic Tac Toe

Project's main objective are Scope and Closure, Factory Function, and Object. Built with plain HTML, CSS, JS.

What I've reached: By this project, I learned to write code in a different way, more private, less poor code security. When working with factory function, I dived deeply into how scope really work in advanced programming, then connect different parts/objects together to make my program smooth. I also learned more about styling with CSS(pseudo elements, radio buttons styling).
