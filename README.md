# Tic-Tac-Toe
TheOdinProject Tic Tac Toe

Project's main objective are Scope and Closure, Factory Function, and Object. Built with plain HTML, CSS, JS.

What I've reached: By this project, now I know the way to write code differently, more private, and more efficient. When working with factory function, I dove deeply into how scope really work in advanced programming, then how to connect different parts/objects together to make my program more fluent. I also got more idea about styling with CSS(pseudo elements, radio buttons styling).
