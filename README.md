# Tic-Tac-Toe
TheOdinProject Tic Tac Toe

The project's main objectives are Scope and Closure, Factory Function, and Object. Built with plain HTML, CSS, and JS.

Through this project, I've gained a comprehensive understanding of writing code in a distinctive, more private, and efficient manner. Delving deeply into the intricacies of scope in advanced programming while working with factory functions has broadened my knowledge. I've learned how to seamlessly connect various parts and objects to enhance the fluidity of my programs. Furthermore, my exploration of styling, including pseudo-elements and radio button styling with CSS, has provided me with valuable insights into creating visually appealing and well-designed interfaces.
